> Production-oriented passive RF situational awareness toolkit for BLE surveillance hardware discovery, proximity tracking, and Remote ID drone detection.

> This project is a from-scratch C rewrite and hardware-specific spinoff of [**OUI-Spy Unified Blue**](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/oui-spy-unified-blue) by [ColonelPanicHacks](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks). The original project pioneered the concept of passive BLE surveillance hardware detection and drone monitoring on ESP32 — this version ports and extends those ideas natively to the ESP32-C6 platform with a custom display UI, hardware buzzer integration, and a modern web interface.

OUI-Spy C6 consolidates three passive RF intelligence modes into a single flash image running on the Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 dev board. Pure ESP-IDF C, no Arduino — just bare metal and radio waves.

## Modes

### Flock You — Surveillance Hardware Detector

Passively scans for Flock Safety ALPR cameras and ShotSpotter Raven acoustic sensors using BLE advertisements.

- **5 detection heuristics**: OUI prefix matching (20 known prefixes), device name pattern matching, Manufacturer Company ID (0x09C8 / XUNTONG), Raven GATT service UUID fingerprinting, and firmware version estimation
- Real-time scrollable device list on the LCD showing RSSI, hit count, and detection method
- Flock LCD now shows live `GPS TAG` status (`ON`/`OFF`) so operators can verify geotagging state at a glance
- New detections trigger an orange LED warning flash, then transition to a breathing red/purple heartbeat whose intensity tracks signal strength
- Idle sweep alternates a dim amber/purple heartbeat so low activity remains visible
- Tracks up to 200 unique devices with MAC deduplication
- CSV export of all detections via web UI

### Fox Hunter — BLE Proximity Tracker

Locks onto a single BLE MAC address and acts as a Geiger counter for Bluetooth — the buzzer beeps faster and the display updates as you physically close in on the target.

- **7-zone RSSI-to-cadence mapping**: from 15ms (machine gun, >-35 dBm) down to 800ms (slow pulse, <-85 dBm)
- Color-mapped proximity bar and signal strength visualization on LCD
- Lost-signal screen waits a short grace period (about 9 seconds) after last contact before switching to full "SIGNAL LOST"
- Targets can be set via the web UI, or imported directly from Flock You detections with a single button hold
- Target MAC persists across reboots via NVS flash storage
- Saved target registry behaves like a compact contact list in the web UI, with live `last seen`, source, and RSSI context when the device is visible in the current session
- Fox registry capacity automatically expands from 8 entries to 32 when a usable microSD card is mounted
- Two toggleable LED tracking modes:

  **Detector Mode:**
  - Solid **orange** LED when no target is set (standing by)
  - Solid **green** LED once a target is selected (hunting)
  - **Blinking red** when the target is detected — blink rate is proportional to signal strength (slow blinks = far away, rapid blinking = right on top of it)

  **Sting Mode:**
  *"...and the light of Eärendil shone upon it." One does not simply walk into range without being noticed.*
  - LED off when no target is set or signal is lost
  - Solid **blue** glow when the target is detected, with brightness proportional to signal strength — dim blue when far, blazing bright blue at close range

  Toggle between Detector and Sting with a double-click while in Fox Hunter mode, or via the web UI toggle button.

### Sky Spy — Drone Detector

Dual-protocol passive drone detection with a Naval CIC-inspired radar display.

- **ASTM F3411 Remote ID** detection via WiFi NAN action frames and BLE Service Data (UUID 0xFFFA)
- **DJI proprietary DroneID** detection via beacon vendor IEs and BLE Company ID (0x2CA3)
- **Parrot** detection via OUI prefix matching
- Parses OpenDroneID message types 0–5: Basic ID, Location, Authentication, Self-ID, System, and Operator ID
- Displays drone serial number, position, altitude, speed, pilot location, and operator info
- Animated phosphor-green radar with rotating sweep, concentric range rings, cardinal labels, and fading trail
- Detected drones appear as amber blips on the radar, positioned by RSSI (distance) and MAC hash (angle) with a blinking animation
- Contact list sidebar with protocol color bars (green = ASTM, red = DJI)
- Green breathing LED while scanning, with orange flash on new drone ping
- Tracks up to 16 simultaneous drones by default, and up to 64 when a usable microSD card is available
- 30-second automatic expiry for stale drone contacts

## Web Interface

A modern single-page dark-themed web UI served directly from the device. Connect to the device's WiFi AP and open **https://192.168.4.1** (preferred) or **http://192.168.4.1** in any browser.

For phone GPS features, use HTTPS. The device uses a local self-signed certificate, so your browser may show a one-time certificate warning before allowing secure-context APIs.
If you use HTTP on iPhone Safari, GPS remains unavailable and the UI keeps GPS state OFF.

- Real-time state updates via WebSocket (500ms push interval)
- Mode switching with animated tab navigation
- Per-mode device lists, proximity visualization, and drone cards
- Fox Hunter target selection and LED mode toggle
- Flock You GPS ON/OFF safety toggle; GPS marking only when enabled and secure (HTTPS)
- GPS toggle is synchronized to firmware state (`gpsTagging`) so web + device stay in sync
- GPS status is now surfaced across the web interface and in the on-device Settings screen, not only in Flock You
- Settings panel: LCD brightness, AP broadcast visibility, single AP naming (UniSpy-C6), LED color palette, sound profiles, GPS tagging, button shortcut mappings, and microSD logging controls
- microSD status is surfaced as `Available`, `Needs Format`, or `Not Found` in both the LCD UI and web UI
- Unformatted but detected cards can be formatted directly from the on-device Settings menu
- When microSD logging is enabled, identity-bearing log records (entries containing device MAC/unique IDs) are written to a protected log file and are not auto-pruned; if storage gets tight, the oldest non-critical event records are trimmed first
- CSV data export for Flock You detections
- Mobile-optimized responsive embedded web UI

### Offline Flock Map Addon

The Flock You web page includes an optional local offline map overlay for pinned Flock camera locations.

- Requirements:
  - Open the device over `https://192.168.4.1`
  - Enable `GPS Tagging` in Settings or the Flock page toggle
  - Allow browser location access so GPS status becomes live
  - Save camera pins from the Flock device list using GPS or manual coordinates
- Access:
  - In the Flock You web UI, triple-click the GPS status tile to open the map panel
  - Double-click the map canvas to cycle zoom levels
- Tiles:
  - Click `Load Tiles` and choose a folder structured like standard slippy-map exports (`z/x/y.png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, or `webp`), such as offline tiles prepared for Meshtastic-style field use
  - If no offline tiles are loaded, the map still shows a gray grid with relative Flock pins
- Notes:
  - Tile loading uses your browser's local file access support; if the browser does not support directory selection, the grid fallback still works
  - Pins come from camera locations you saved in the web UI, so populate those first for a meaningful map

## WiFi Access Points

Each mode can run its own dedicated WiFi AP, or you can enable a unified AP name in Settings:

| Mode | SSID | Password | Channel |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Mode Select | `ouispy-c6` | `ouispy123` | 6 |
| Flock You | `flockyou-c6` | `flockyou123` | 6 |
| Fox Hunter | `foxhunt-c6` | `foxhunt123` | 6 |
| Sky Spy | `skyspy-c6` | `skyspy1234` | 6 |

When `Single AP Name` is enabled, all modes use `UniSpy-C6` with password `ouispy123`.

All modes use channel 6 for optimal alignment with Remote ID NAN detection.

## Build & Flash

### Prerequisites

- [ESP-IDF v5.3.2](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.2/esp32c6/get-started/) on Windows
- Python 3.11 for the ESP-IDF build environment

### Build

```bash
cd ouispy-c6
idf.py set-target esp32c6
idf.py build
```

### One-Step Flash + Monitor

```bash
python flash.py --port COMx
```

`flash.py` can first offer downloading the latest prebuilt firmware release (no local build required), or build from source, then flashes the board, starts a serial monitor, and saves timestamped crash logs under `logs/`.

### Manual Flash

```bash
# If the board doesn't enter flash mode automatically:
# Hold BOOT → press RESET → release RESET → release BOOT
idf.py -p COMx flash monitor
```

Replace `COMx` with your serial port (e.g., `COM3` on Windows, `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux).

### First Boot

1. LCD shows the gold & purple OUI-SPY boot splash with startup melody
2. Device starts a WiFi AP (`ouispy-c6` / `ouispy123` by default, or `UniSpy-C6` if unified AP naming is enabled)
3. Connect your phone or laptop to the AP
4. Open **http://192.168.4.1** in a browser
5. Select a mode from the on-screen selector or web UI
